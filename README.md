# Nittany AI Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning and AI projects developed for the Nittany AI initiative. Each project demonstrates different aspects of AI and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

### 1) FlowerIdentify
A machine learning project focused on iris flower classification using the famous Iris dataset. This project:
- Uses the Iris dataset with features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width
- Implements data visualization using seaborn and matplotlib
- Maps three iris species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) to numerical values
- Demonstrates basic classification techniques

### 2) RecognizeNumber
A deep learning project for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. This project:
- Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Uses PyTorch for model development and training
- Includes training and testing functions for model evaluation
- Demonstrates image classification techniques for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9)

### 3) FineTune
A transfer learning project that fine-tunes a pre-trained model for flower classification. This project:
- Uses TensorFlow and Keras for model development
- Downloads and processes a flower image dataset
- Implements transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained model
- Demonstrates how to adapt existing models to new classification tasks

### 4) RAGAndre
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project that enhances language model responses with external knowledge. This project:
- Uses OpenAI's API for embeddings and completions
- Implements text chunking for processing large documents
- Uses vector similarity (cosine similarity) to retrieve relevant information
- Demonstrates how to combine retrieval mechanisms with generative AI

## Getting Started
Each project includes both a Python script (.py) and a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) version. The Jupyter notebooks provide a more interactive experience with visualizations and step-by-step execution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- OpenAI API (for RAG project)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
